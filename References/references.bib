	abstract = {Over the last decade there has been a shift from ldquodata-awarerdquo information systems to ldquoprocess-awarerdquo information systems. To support business processes an enterprise information system needs to be aware of these processes and their organizational context. Business Process Management (BPM) includes methods, techniques, and tools to support the design, enactment, management, and analysis of such operational business processes. BPM can be considered as an extension of classical Workflow Management (WFM) systems and approaches. This tutorial introduces models, systems, and standards for the design, analysis, and enactment of workflow processes. Petri nets are used for the modeling and analysis of workflows. Using Petri nets as a formal basis, contemporary systems, languages, and standards for BPM and WFM are discussed. Although it is clear that Petri nets can serve as a solid foundation for BPM/WFM technology, in reality systems, languages, and standards are developed in an ad-hoc fashion. To illustrate this XPDL, the ldquoLingua Francardquo proposed by the Workflow Management Coalition (WfMC), is analyzed using a set of 20 basic workflow patterns. This analysis exposes some of the typical semantic problems restricting the application of BPM/WFM technology.},

	abstract = {Contemporary workflow management systems are driven by explicit process models, i.e., a completely specified workflow design is required in order to enact a given workflow process. Creating a workflow design is a complicated time-consuming process and, typically, there are discrepancies between the actual workflow processes and the processes as perceived by the management. Therefore, we have developed techniques for discovering workflow models. The starting point for such techniques is a so-called "workflow log" containing information about the workflow process as it is actually being executed. We present a new algorithm to extract a process model from such a log and represent it in terms of a Petri net. However, we also demonstrate that it is not possible to discover arbitrary workflow processes. We explore a class of workflow processes that can be discovered. We show that the {\&}alpha;-algorithm can successfully mine any workflow represented by a so-called SWF-net.},

	abstract = {Contemporary information systems (e.g., WfM, ERP, CRM, SCM, and B2B systems) record business events in so-called event logs. Business process mining takes these logs to discover process, control, data, organizational, and social structures. Although many researchers are developing new and more powerful process mining techniques and software vendors are incorporating these in their software, few of the more advanced process mining techniques have been tested on real-life processes. This paper describes the application of process mining in one of the provincial offices of the Dutch National Public Works Department, responsible for the construction and maintenance of the road and water infrastructure. Using a variety of process mining techniques, we analyzed the processing of invoices sent by the various subcontractors and suppliers from three different perspectives: (1) the process perspective, (2) the organizational perspective, and (3) the case perspective. For this purpose, we used some of the tools developed in the context of the ProM framework. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the applicability of process mining in general and our algorithms and tools in particular. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Process mining allows for the automated discovery of process models from event logs. These models provide insights and enable various types of model-based analysis. This paper demonstrates that the discovered process models can be extended with information to predict the completion time of running instances. There are many scenarios where it is useful to have reliable time predictions. For example, when a customer phones her insurance company for information about her insurance claim, she can be given an estimate for the remaining processing time. In order to do this, we provide a configurable approach to construct a process model, augment this model with time information learned from earlier instances, and use this to predict e.g., the completion time. To provide meaningful time predictions we use a configurable set of abstractions that allow for a good balance between "overfitting" and "underfitting". The approach has been implemented in ProM and through several experiments using real-life event logs we demonstrate its applicability. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Business process prediction technologies are being increasingly used by organisations to provide timely feedback to their customers and improve their overall productivity. In order to provide valuable information to both customers and system managers, the timings of business processes need to be forecast with high accuracy and efficiency. In particular, organisations require to predict the process and event flows, recognize their patterns, and forecast the total time it would take for a workflow to complete, in order to meet the Service Level Agreements (SLAs) signed with the customers. In this paper, we focus on the prediction models that could be used for forecasting time to completion of business processes by analysing historical event logs. First, we propose a service oriented architecture that provides a test-bed for carrying out predictions on business processes. Second, we propose a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based prediction technique that produces a model based on event logs, and compare it against existing prediction models. Finally, we describe an implementation of the system, where we simulate the execution of a business process and obtain predictions using both the proposed and existing prediction techniques. {\textcopyright} 2011 ICST.},

A model of this type can be used for active real-time-controlling (e. g. through the reassignment of workflow activities based on prediction results) or for the automated support of redesign (i.e., prediction results are transformed in software requirements used to implement process improvements).

@phdthesis{Kang2014,
	abstract = {Complex information systems generate large amount of event logs that represent the states of system dynamics. By monitoring these logs, we can learn the process models that describe the underlying business procedures, predict the future development of the systems, and check whether the process models match the expected ones. Most of the existing process monitoring techniques are derived from the workflow management systems used to cope with the logs generated by systems with deterministic outcomes. In this dissertation, however, I consider novel techniques that handle event log data, monitor system deviations, and infer the development of systems based on probabilistic process models. In particular, I present a novel process monitoring approach based on maximizing the information divergences of the system state dynamics and demonstrate its efficiency in detecting abrupt changes, as well as long-term system deviation. In addition, a new process modeling technique, Classification Tree hidden (semi-) Markov Model (CTHMM), is proposed. I show that CTHMM derived from Classification and Regression Tree and hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) with hidden system states identified by Classification Tree can help discover and predict relevant system state sequences in temporal-probabilistic manners. The main contributions of this dissertation can be summarized as follows: 1) a new approach used in process monitoring that helps detect anomalies of dynamic systems from the point of views of both system change-point and long-term system deviation; 2) a unique HMM/HSMM learning technique that solves the problem of hidden state splitting and estimates HMM/HSMM parameters simultaneously; 3) a novel temporal-probabilistic process model that generates humancomprehensible IF-THEN system state definitions used to help infer evolutions of discrete dynamic systems.},

One of the promising approaches is online failure prediction, which means that the current state of the system is evaluated in order to predict the occurrence of failures in the near future. More specifically, we focus on methods that use event-driven sources such as errors. We use hidden semi-Markov models (HSMMs)for this purpose and demonstrate effectiveness based on field data of a commercial telecommunication system. For comparative analysis we selected three well-known failure prediction techniques: a straightforward method that is based on a reliability model, dispersion frame technique by Lin and Siewiorek and the eventset-based method introduced by Vilalta et al. We assess and compare the methods in terms of precision, recall, F-measure, false-positive rate, and computing time. The experiments suggest that our HSMM approach is very effective with respect to online failure prediction.},

In business process mining, the goal is also to extract sequence behaviour from an event log but the problem is often simplified by assuming that each event is already known to belong to a given process and process instance. In this paper, we describe two experiments where this information is not available. One is based on a real-world case study of observing a software development team for three weeks. The other is based on simulation and shows that it is possible to recover the original behaviour in a fully automated way. In both experiments, sequence clustering plays a central role.},

	abstract = {Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are a stochastic signal mod-eling formalism that is actively used in the machine learning community for a wide range of applications such as speech and activity recognition. Efficient techniques exist to learn HMM models from a given data set, and to estimate the data likelihood with respect to a given HMM (i.e., " How probable is it that these data were produced by this HMM? "). The latter enables the evaluation and selection of suitable models. In the domain of process mining the evaluation of models (i.e., " How can we measure the quality of a mined process model? ") is still subject to ongoing research. Because the types of models used in process mining are typically on a higher level of abstraction (i.e., they are more expressive as they, for example, allow to capture concurrency), the problem of model evaluation is challenging. In this paper, we investigate the possibilities and limitations of using HMMs for evaluating process models and com-pare the resulting quality measurements to the metrics typically used in the process mining domain.},

	abstract = {A hidden Markov model (HMM) encompasses a large class of stochastic process models and has been successfully applied to a number of scientific and engineering problems, including speech and other pattern recognition problems, and DNA sequence comparison. A hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) is an extension of HMM, designed to remove the constant or geometric distributions of the state durations assumed in HMM. A larger class of practical problems can be appropriately modeled in the setting of HSMM. A major restriction is found, however, in both conventional HMM and HSMM, i.e., it is generally assumed that there exists at least one observation associated with every state that the hidden Markov chain takes on. We will remove this assumption and consider the following situations: (i) observation data may be missing for some intervals; and (ii) there are multiple observation streams that are not necessarily synchronous to each other and may have different "emission distributions" for the same state. We propose a new and computationally efficient forward-backward algorithm for HSMM with missing observations and multiple observation sequences. The required computational amount for the forward and backward variables is reduced to O(D), where D is the maximum allowed duration in a state. Finally, we will apply the extended HSMM to estimate the mobility model parameters for the Internet service provisioning in wireless networks. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {As an extension to the popular hidden Markov model (HMM), a hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) allows the underlying stochastic process to be a semi-Markov chain. Each state has variable duration and a number of observations being produced while in the state. This makes it suitable for use in a wider range of applications. Its forward-backward algorithms can be used to estimate/update the model parameters, determine the predicted, filtered and smoothed probabilities, evaluate goodness of an observation sequence fitting to the model, and find the best state sequence of the underlying stochastic process. Since the HSMM was initially introduced in 1980 for machine recognition of speech, it has been applied in thirty scientific and engineering areas, such as speech recognition/synthesis, human activity recognition/prediction, handwriting recognition, functional MRI brain mapping, and network anomaly detection. There are about three hundred papers published in the literature. An overview of HSMMs is presented in this paper, including modelling, inference, estimation, implementation and applications. It first provides a unified description of various HSMMs and discusses the general issues behind them. The boundary conditions of HSMM are extended. Then the conventional models, including the explicit duration, variable transition, and residential time of HSMM, are discussed. Various duration distributions and observation models are presented. Finally, the paper draws an outline of the applications. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Activity recognition is a process by which the ongoing observed behavior of an agent is tracked and mapped to a given model, explaining the behavior and accounting for hidden or unobservable state (e.g., goals or beliefs of the obser ved agents). Various methods for activity recognition exist. A popular family of such methods rely on Hidden Markov Models HMMs and variants for recognition. These models, however, do not account for changes in transition probabilities base d on the duration an agent has spent in a given state. This paper investigates Markov models that go beyond existing models, to explicitly model the dependency of transition probabilities on state duration. In particular, we propose the use of Non-stationary Hidden Semi Markov Models (NHSMMs) in activity recognition. We present the NHSMM model, and compare its performance in recognizing normal and abnormal behavior, using synthetic da ta from an industry simulator. We show that for relatively simple activity recognition tasks, both HSMMs and NHSMMs easily and significantly outperform HMMs. In more complex tasks, the NHSMMs also outperf orm the HSMMs, and allow significantly more accurately recognition.},

	abstract = {A large part of the society depends on technology. It is important that such technology is dependable. In order to make computer systems dependable, various techniques are available. One such technique is failure prediction. While failure prediction alone will not increase the dependability, it provides valuable information to facilitate the increase of availability and reliability of computer systems. The anticipation of upcoming failures allows to perform countermeasures in order to prevent computer systems from reaching a failure state or prepare them for faster recovery. This thesis proposes an accelerator design on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) for a failure prediction algorithm. The prediction method is based on the processing of error event sequences and modelled with a Hidden Semi-Markov Model (HSMM). The sequence processing is using the forward algorithm. The design and implementation of the forward algorithm is provided in a fixed-point data representation and proposes a simple operand scaling method with a low overhead. The design focuses on low resource utilisation and energy consumption. The accelerator outperforms conventional processors, in some cases, by almost a factor of 50.},

It is demonstrated that either a three-state ESHMM or a standard HMM with an increased number of states is capable of closely matching both Gamma distributions and duration distributions of phonemes from the TIMIT corpus, as measured by Bhattacharyya distance to the true distributions. Standard HMMs are easily implemented with off-the-shelf tools, whereas duration models require substantial algorithmic development and have higher computational costs when implemented, suggesting that a simple adjustment to HMM topologies is perhaps a more efficient solution to the problem of duration than more complex approaches.},

It is however, known to be prohibitively costly when estimation is performed from long observation sequences. Several alternatives have been proposed in literature to reduce the memory complexity of FB at the expense of increased time complexity. In this paper, a novel variation of the FB algorithm - called the Efficient Forward Filtering Backward Smoothing (EFFBS) - is proposed to reduce the memory complexity without the computational overhead. Given an HMM with N states and an observation sequence of length T, both FB and EFFBS algorithms have the same time complexity, O (N2 T). Nevertheless, FB has a memory complexity of O (NT), while EFFBS has a memory complexity that is independent of T, O (N). EFFBS requires fewer resources than FB, yet provides the same results. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
